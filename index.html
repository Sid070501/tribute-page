                Swami Vivekananda was a Hindu monk and one of the most famous spiritual leaders in India. It was more than a spiritual mind; He was a prolific thinker, a great public speaker, and a passionate patriot.  The young monk and his teachings were an inspiration to many, and his words became targets of self-improvement, especially for the youth of the country. For this reason, his birthday, January 12th, is celebrated in India as National Youth Day. Read this full post to know more about Swami Vivekananda Biography, Teachings, Early Life, Works, Ideas.
                Swami Vivekananda continued the free-thinking philosophy of his guru Ramakrishna Paramhansa towards a new paradigm. He worked tirelessly to improve society, served the poor and needy, and devoted all his efforts to the country. He was responsible for reviving Hindu spiritualism and establishing Hinduism as a revered religion on the world stage. His message of universal brotherhood and self-awakening remains relevant, especially in the current context of widespread political unrest around the world.
